## Description

Do you know how much money you spend on food? On entertainment? It's quite interesting to know since the main purpose of this application is to analyze your expenses. Let's implement this feature!

First, add the Analyze item to the menu. This way you will request an analysis of your purchases.

Once this item is called you need to offer a way to sort the purchases.

There are three of them:

Sort All – sort the entire shopping list and display it so that the most expensive purchases are at the top of the list.
Sort By Type – show which category eats the most money. If a category has no purchases in it the total sum should be $0.
Sort Certain Type – same as Sort All, but for a specific category.
Example
The greater-than symbol followed by a space (> ) represents the user input. Notice that it's not part of the input.
